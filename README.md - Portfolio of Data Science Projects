### Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio of data science projects! This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise and skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. Each project is designed to address real-world challenges and provide actionable insights to drive business value.

### Projects Included
1. **Salifort Motor Employee Turnover Prediction**
   - Objective: Predict employee turnover to identify factors influencing attrition and propose retention strategies.
   - Techniques Used: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation.
   - Outcome: Champion model achieved 97% AUC score, providing valuable insights for the HR department.

2. **Waze User Churn Prediction**
   - Objective: Predict user churn to improve user retention and enhance user experience on the Waze navigation app.
   - Techniques Used: Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Outcome: Developed a predictive model with 85% accuracy to identify potential churners and implement targeted retention strategies.
